# data object sources.
-> Page types?

schema: {
  template/filename
  data
}

## data
to be asynchronous we'll need a get function....
do we pass it a list, or fetch function?

it needs to know
  * how to render the page
  * what to show in the edit screen

possibilities:
  * single templates for multiple data objects
  * individual pages.
